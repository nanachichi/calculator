# JS calculator

A simple JavaScript calculator.

Click [**here**](https://nanachichi.github.io/calculator/) to try it out.

There is **keyboard support**. You can type digits (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /) and a '.' (point).

Other key bindings:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| % | Calculate percentage |
| Tab | +/− (the plus–minus sign) |
| Enter *or* = | = (the equal sign) |
| Escape | Clear the display |
| Backspace | Clear last character |

This project helped me **understand JS objects better** and despite facing some challenges, I tried my best to keep the code **clean**.
